Momentum and Position:
This is currently implemnted wrong. We need to transform the mesh
so that it has it's true dimensions, rather than working with
normalized coordinates. This will drastically simplify a bunch of the code.

Until that happens (hopefully I'll document it at the very least in the
git checkins) all velocities and positions must be put into normalized
coordinates. Since the forces are going to be the real forces this
means that delta(p) must be normalized by dividing by the length scale.

--Update!
I checked the code, and I was wrong. I should not normalize pkx. I should
only normalize the x coordinate.

--Update 2:
I was seeing momentums on the order of 10^-8, which looked good, until
I remembered that this was momentum. I need to divide by the number of 
particles in the cluster to deal with the increased mass.
