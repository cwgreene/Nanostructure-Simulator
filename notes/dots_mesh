How many vertices in a nxn square?

 x x x x

start off with 4 dots

adding a row adds c+1 dots, increases r by 1
adding a column adds r+1 dots, increases c by 1

adding a row, and then a column increases by (c+1)+((r+1)+1)
so going from nxn (z) => (n+1)x(n+1) is  z + (n+1)+((n+1)+1)=z+2n+3


(n+1)*(n+1)

so 1x1 => 2x2 => 4+2+3=9

1 4
2 9
3
