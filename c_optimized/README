The makefile should get everything working properly. I probably need
to do some sort of autoconfigure thing amabob to check for dependencies to
make it play nice with everyone.

To test the python scripts, you have to run them from the directory below.
This is due partially to historical decisions, and the fact that I wanted
all the python scripts in the root directory. If you try and run the
python in this directory after building, it will fail.
