Things to get done:

1) Renormalize the mesh so that ALL mesh cells are the same size. If we don't
do this, we mess up the charge_density calculations.

a)how to do this:
	Figure out how to make a submesh, and then intersect the mesh
we don't want out.

	Alternatively, write script to tile the triangle by hand.

2) Get more realistic replenish working.

3) Scattering and recombination. To a certain exten the gradients
provide this to a limited extent, so it is perhaps not critical for a
qualitative evaluation of the problem. NOTE: are We are simulating a metal for
 without scatter?.

4) FIGURE out if the lack of a true depletion region is realistic or not.
Easiest way is to generate code for the N-Gon mesh and hollowed internal
thingy and see if it matches the cylindrical calculations.

5) VERY IMPORTANT: Extract current information. Don't forget! Easy calc is
just find out if nearest exit was an inner or outer boundary and then just
add in the charge. This shouldn't be too hard.

6) Transform current averages into running totals (possibly as class) and dump them at the end. That way we can see if the average begins to converge. important
averages would be the current.

7) are we going fast enough?

8) Need to update moved electrons into inverse list
